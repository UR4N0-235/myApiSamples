# Notes

This project is just a note, just one entity, to learn more about tests with jest, built with NestJs on backend

This entity has one attribute, that is note.

## Logic errors?
On createNoteDto and updateNoteDto, note has received with name body, I don't know I tried this other name, but I not have patience to change, this is working but not make sense to me.
